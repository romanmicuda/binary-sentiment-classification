# Sentiment Analysis Model

This repository contains code for training and performing inference with a sentiment analysis model built using PyTorch.

## Setup Environment

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the required dependencies for Python 3.12:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Training the Model
To train the sentiment analysis model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```
This script loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, defines the model architecture, and trains the model using the specified parameters. It may also support options for saving the trained model and logging training progress (check the script for additional flags or configuration).

### Running Inference
To perform inference using the pre-trained sentiment analysis model, run:
```bash
python inference.py
```
This script loads a pre-trained model, preprocesses input data, and generates predictions. Predictions can be output to a file or displayed, depending on the scriptâ€™s options (refer to the script for details).

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- PyTorch (specified in `requirements.txt`)
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Notes
- Ensure you have a compatible GPU for faster training if using PyTorch with CUDA support.
- Modify file paths or configurations in `train.py` and `inference.py` as needed for your dataset or model.
